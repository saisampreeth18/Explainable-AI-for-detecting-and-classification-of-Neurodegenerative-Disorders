# Explainable AI-Based Alzheimer’s Disease Detection

This project presents an AI-based system to detect Alzheimer’s disease stages 
from brain MRI images using Transfer Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

## Problem Statement
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging due to manual MRI analysis,
which is time-consuming and depends on expert knowledge.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses a transfer learning-based deep learning model to classify
Alzheimer’s disease into four stages and explains predictions using XAI techniques.

## Features
- Brain MRI-based Alzheimer detection
- Multi-stage classification:
  - Non-Demented
  - Very Mild Demented
  - Mild Demented
  - Moderate Demented
- Transfer Learning (EfficientNet / ResNet)
- Explainable AI using Grad-CAM and LIME
- Flask-based web application
- Cloud deployment using Google Colab

## Modules
1. User Interface
